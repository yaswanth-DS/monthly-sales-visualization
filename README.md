# Monthly Sales Visualization Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing monthly sales data using Python data visualization techniques. 
The objective is to understand sales trends, distribution patterns, and identify potential outliers 
to support data-driven business decisions.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Visualizations Used
- Bar Chart – To compare monthly sales performance  
- Line Chart – To observe sales trends over time  
- Histogram – To analyze the distribution of sales values  
- Boxplot – To detect outliers in sales data  

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Sales show a gradual increase across months.
- June records an unusually high sales value.
- The value **90000** is identified as a potential outlier.
- Further investigation is required to determine whether the spike is due to a special event, bulk order, or data anomaly.

## 📈 Business Value
This analysis helps stakeholders:
- Identify abnormal sales behavior
- Understand overall sales performance
- Make informed business and forecasting decisions
